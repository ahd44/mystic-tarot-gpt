## Mystic Tarot GPT

Created by [Andrew Debevec](https://www.andrewdebevec.com/), using Next.js, React.js, TypeScript, and integration with ChatGPT.

The aim for this project was to create a Tarot reading program, that displayed the tarot cards as they were read and streamed responses from ChatGPT. Tarot can be used as a brainstorming tool or a way to look at problems from different angles, and using the randomness of a Tarot deck along with the power of ChatGPT enables one to receive a more "objective" interpretation than doing it for oneself.

As mentioned in the main page, the images are from the Rider-Waite Tarot, illustrated by Pamela Colman Smith, which is in the public domain in most countries. The reader images are AI-generated using Stable Diffusion.
